# Frontend Meta Course Learning

Welcome to my Frontend Meta Course Learning repository! This repository serves as a record of my journey through the Meta Frontend Developer Professional Certficate Course on Coursera. Here, you'll find code and projects related to HTML and CSS as part of my learning process.

## What's Inside?

- Projects showcasing HTML and CSS concepts.
- Code snippets and examples from course exercises.

Feel free to explore the content as a reference or source of inspiration for your own learning.

## Note

This repository is a personal learning journey, and I'm not accepting contributions. As the projects here are small-scale and intended for personal growth, collaboration and contributions aren't applicable.

Happy coding!
